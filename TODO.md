# TODO (is planned to happen some time)

* Make all pages "any screen size" friendly


# Future plans (may not happen)

* A games section
* A server that does more than provide files
* A bug report section
* A poll/post section like a social media
* Integrated Discord app if that's not illegal (support for viewing and chatting in a Discord server using this website)
* More automation using more than 0 api's, such as youtube api for video uploads
